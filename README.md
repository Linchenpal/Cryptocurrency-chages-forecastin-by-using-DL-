Set-Up
I have installed Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/), which comes with Jypiter Ntebook ( which i find good for beginners as me  .-))
We used TensorFlow(TF) and Keras ( are 2 key dependencies to run the algo: TF and Keras are Libraries. I used the following tutorial to be installed in a Ubuntu MAchine, but i installed ij my MAc, cmd are almost the same)

NOTE: Be sure to create a Kernel where to run the algo. That kernel must be shown in your Jypiter notebook ( maybe fro most of u guys out here is evident for me took me a lot of night to get to that point :v)
